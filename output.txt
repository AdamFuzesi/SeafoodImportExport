Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021: Recovery
In 2021 Canada’s aggregate seafood trade mostly recovered from the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, there remain areas of weakness in individual markets.
By mid-2020, COVID-19 had caused sharp falls in traded quantities and values for
essentially every major seafood export and import. As the year progressed, the situation
improved and in 2021 the recovery was led by booming demand from the United States.
In contrast, the quantities traded with Asia - including China, Japan, Hong Kong, and
India – recovered only modestly and mostly remained below pre-pandemic levels.

Canada’s overall traded quantities have returned to pre-pandemic levels, but the
pandemic has caused a mild shift towards the already dominant markets in the
Americas for both exports and imports. Trade with Europe (EU as well as other
countries) has also become a larger share. More details on the major partners and
species behind these trends are provided in the following pages.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
Canada’s Fish and Seafood Exports
In 2021, Canada’s fish and seafood exports were valued at $8.79B, an increase of 36
per cent ($2.35B) over 2020. This represents both a recovery from the economic effects
of COVID-19 and a continuation of the long-term upward trend in the value of seafood
exports. Quantity-wise Canada exported 613 thousand tonnes of fish and seafood in
2021, an 8 per cent increase from the previous year. Overall export prices increased by
26 per cent, due to more favorable exchange rates that increased the value of exports
in Canadian dollar terms as well as recovering demand following COVID-19.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Exports by Destination
The United States has historically been the most significant destination for Canadian
seafood exports, even as the share destined for China has grown rapidly. However,
exports to China fell sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic and have yet to recover to
the same extent as other markets, while trade with the United States has recovered and
strengthened.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
United States
In 2021, 70 per cent of Canadian fish and seafood exports were exported to the United
States. The value of seafood exports to the United States increased by 50 per cent in
2021 to $6.18B. Quantities recovered similarly approaching the most recent high from
pre-pandemic years, which occurred in 2016.

In 2021, Canada’s top fish and seafood exports by value to the US were
lobster ($2.25B), crab ($1.82B), and salmon ($1.06B). Together, these three species
accounted for 83 per cent of total Canadian seafood exports by value to the US.

The importance of the US market for Canada was underlined throughout the COVID-19
pandemic. Exports to the US fell proportionally less than to other trade partners at the
beginning, and have recovered more vigorously. Between 2020 and 2021 the value of
Canada’s exports to the US grew by 50 per cent compared to 36 per cent for the world
as a whole. While the increasing concentration of Canadian fish and seafood exports to
the US markets leaves Canada exposed to changes in American policy, exchange rate,
and demand shocks, easy access to this large economy remains a significant asset for
Canadian exporters.
Beginning on January 1, 2023 the United States will require fish and seafood imports to
comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) Import Provisions. To maintain
US market access under the MMPA, exporting nations, including Canada, will have to
meet US standards to mitigate harm to marine mammals. Canada has initiated a
number of measures to meet the requirements of the US MMPA Import Provisions in
close collaboration with Canadian harvesters and other stakeholders.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
China
China remained the second most valuable export destination for Canada’s fish and
seafood in 2021. Improved prices meant that total exports were worth $1.12B,
accounting for 13 per cent of Canada’s total fish and seafood exports by value, despite
a continuing decline in volumes.

Prior to 2020, Canada’s fish and seafood export value to China was experiencing strong
and consistent yearly growth. However, export volume declined in 2020 and again in
2021 due to the ongoing economic effects of COVID-19 and related public health policy
measures. Prices for Canadian exports of fish and seafood to China recovered well in
2021 with an increase of 26 per cent compared to 2020, slightly ahead of the United
States, and sufficient to offset the decrease in quantity of 15 per cent. Ultimately,
Canadian fish and seafood export value to China increased by 8 per cent ($80M)
6
Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
between 2020 and 2021, somewhat less than the 36 per cent recovery overall that was
driven by the US.
In 2021, Canada’s top fish and seafood exports by value to China were lobster ($484M),
crab ($223M), and shrimp ($149M). Together, these three species accounted for 77 per
cent of the value of Canadian fish and seafood exports to China.

Canada continued to be China’s largest supplier of live lobster6 in 2021, accounting for
79 per cent of that market.7 Historically, Canada and the US had shared more equally in
China’s live lobster import market. However, since the US-China trade disputes and
tariff escalation between the two countries began in 2018, the market share of live US
lobster plummeted, from 41 per cent in 2017 to just 2 per cent in 2019, followed by a
modest recovery to 21 per cent in 2021.8 This collapse was primarily due to the
retaliatory tariffs placed on US lobster during 2018 and 2019.

European Union
In 2021, Canada’s fish and seafood exports to the 27 current members of the EU were
valued at $453M, accounting for 5 per cent of Canada’s total fish and seafood exports
by value, and making it the third-largest export market for Canadian fish and seafood.
Export value increased 19 per cent and quantities increased by 2 per cent in 2021,
compared with 2020. Both increases were lower than the overall increases for Canada’s
global seafood exports, of 36 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.

Canada’s top fish and seafood exports to the EU by value in 2021 were
lobster ($255M), shrimp ($69M), and scallops ($51M). Together, these three species
accounted for 83 per cent of total Canadian fish and seafood exports by value to the
EU.

Of the 27 current members of the European Union, the five largest markets for Canada
in 2021 were France ($82M), Belgium ($78M), Denmark ($72M), Spain ($70M), and the
Netherlands ($68M). Together these five countries received 82 per cent of Canada’s
seafood exports to the European Union.
Other Destinations
In 2021, Canadian exports to the remaining destinations were valued at $1.04B,
representing 12 per cent of Canada’s total fish and seafood export value. Among these
the most valuable destinations were Japan ($249M), Hong Kong ($166M), South Korea
($129M), and the United Kingdom ($111M).
The quantity and value of seafood exported to Japan recovered modestly in 2021.
However, total value exported remained below 2016-2019 levels. Canada’s top seafood
exports by value to Japan were crab ($72M, virtually all snow crab), herring ($35M),
lobster ($33M), and salmon ($25M). Together, these four species accounted for 66 per
cent of total Canadian fish and seafood exports by value to Japan.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
Similarly, the recovery of the quantity and value of seafood exported to Hong Kong was
positive in 2021, but with totals still below the levels seen between 2016 and 2019. By
contrast, exports to South Korea recovered from the pandemic and ultimately exceeded
pre-pandemic trade in both value and quantity.
The seventh largest destination economy for Canadian seafood exports is now the
United Kingdom. Compared to the previous year, exports in 2021 rose by 70 per cent to
$111M. This was supported by both quantities increasing 50 per cent and prices
increasing 13 per cent. However this rapid growth follows a sharp decline in 2020 and
merely represents a return to the pre-pandemic trend, when trade was governed by the
Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Exports by Species
The three main species that Canada exports are lobster, crab, and salmon. Together
these species make up 75 per cent of the value of Canada’s fish and seafood exports.

Lobster
In 2021, lobster made up 37 per cent of Canada’s seafood exports. Lobster exports
consisted of frozen (42 per cent by value), canned (20 per cent), and live (38 per cent).
By volume, the main lobster exporting provinces in 2021 were Nova Scotia (52.6
thousand tonnes), New Brunswick (27.3 thousand tonnes), and Prince Edward Island
(9.6 thousand tonnes). By value, these three provinces exported 92 per cent of
Canada’s lobster exports in 2021.
Canadian exports of lobster rose to a new high in in 2021 mainly due to increased
quantities and prices in the American market. Overall export value increased by $1.17B
(56 per cent) from 2020 to 2021 and quantity increased by 14 thousand tonnes (17 per
cent).

The United States was the destination for 69 per cent of Canadian lobster exports in
2021, in line with historical norms. The value of Canada’s lobster exports to the United
States increased by 71 per cent ($931M) and quantities increased by 28 per cent (12
thousand tonnes). By value, Canada’s lobster exports to the US mostly consisted of
frozen (48 per cent by value), canned (29 per cent), and live (23 per cent) lobster.
China remained the second-largest destination, 15 per cent by value, for Canada’s
lobster exports in 2021. The value of lobster exports to China recovered by 19 per cent
($77M) even as quantities declined by 4 per cent (0.97 thousand tonnes). While this
does not bring values back to where they were in 2019, it is still significantly higher than
values seen prior to 2018. The majority of Canadian lobster was exported live (94 per
cent by value in 2021) to China.
12
Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
The third largest destination for Canadian lobster in 2021 was the European Union.
Lobster exports to the EU were nearly evenly divided between live and frozen lobster.

Crab
In 2021 crab exports, worth $2.18B, accounted for 25 per cent of Canada’s seafood
exports by value. Of this, 71 per cent was identified as frozen snow crab, with another
14 per cent identified as unspecified frozen crab; based on harvests and geography,
this is most likely also snow crab.
The main crab exporting province was Newfoundland and Labrador with exports worth
$883M. New Brunswick, $364M, Nova Scotia, $351M, and Quebec, $273M, are also
significant exporters of snow crab. British Columbia also exported crab valued at
$255M, mostly live Dungeness crab destined for China and the US.

Crab prices have been strong in recent years and export quantities have mainly been
determined by harvests. In 2021, Canada’s crab export value increased 64 per cent
($854M) from the previous year. This was due to both increased prices, up by 42 per
cent, and quantities, up by 15 per cent.

Salmon
Canada exported $1.1B worth of salmon in 2021, comprising 13 per cent of total
seafood exports. Of this, 83 per cent was farmed Atlantic salmon, a proportion
essentially unchanged from 2020.

Quantities and total value grew modestly in 2021. Quantities rose by 10 per cent, and
total value rose by 15 per cent or $145M. British Columbia exported salmon worth
$666M, while New Brunswick exported $401M. These two provinces accounted for 96
per cent of Canada’s salmon exports. The United States received 95 per cent of
Canada’s salmon exports.

Other Species
In 2021 species other than lobster, crab, and salmon, made up just 25 per cent of the
value of Canada’s seafood exports. Of the remaining species, shrimp, halibut and
scallops were the next most valuable exports.
In 2021 shrimp and prawn were mainly exported from Newfoundland and Labrador
($177M), Nova Scotia ($145M), and British Columbia ($42M). They were mainly
destined for China ($149M), the EU ($69M), and the United Kingdom ($52M). The
majority (85 per cent) of Canadian shrimp exported in 2021 consisted of frozen cold-
water shrimps, essentially unchanged from 2020.
Canadian exports of halibut in 2021 were mainly from Nova Scotia ($116M),
Newfoundland and Labrador ($54M), and British Columbia ($42M). They were mainly
destined for the United States ($155M) and China ($40M). Halibut exports consisted of
both fresh (32 per cent) and frozen (68 per cent) halibut.
17
Canada’s Fish and Seafood Trade in 2021
In 2021, 89 per cent of scallop exports were from Nova Scotia ($169M). They were

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Exports by Province and Territory
In 2021 provincial seafood exports recovered generally with the largest recoveries seen
in the Atlantic provinces where lobster and snow crab dominate. Provinces with more
exposure to still-subdued Asian markets, mainly British Columbia, saw less pronounced
recoveries from the declines in 2020.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Imports
In 2021 Canada imported $4.61B of seafood. The main imports were salmon, shrimp
and prawn, lobster, tuna, and crab. While exported products largely reflect Canadian
harvests, imports provide Canadians with a more diverse choice of seafood, as well as
more economical choices including those sourced from aquaculture. Imports also
include fish and shellfish that may be processed in Canada for domestic or international
markets.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Imports by Origin
As a share of the value of Canada’s fish and seafood imports, the United States
supplied 36 per cent, while China supplied 11 per cent, and Viet Nam 7 per cent.
Because there is a strong geographical component to fisheries production, a greater
diversity in imported products is accompanied by a greater diversity of import partners.

In 2021, Canadian fish and seafood imports from suppliers other than the top 3 were
valued at $2.10B, representing 46 per cent of Canada’s total fish and seafood import
value.

Canada’s Fish and Seafood Imports by Species
The top three import species in 2021 were salmon, shrimp and prawn, and lobster,
jointly making up 48 per cent of Canada’s seafood imports.

In 2021, salmon made up 20 per cent of Canada’s seafood imports. The main sources
were the United States ($491M), Chile ($233M), and Norway ($75M). This was primarily
salmon fillets, either fresh (29 per cent) or frozen (17 per cent).
Shrimp and prawn were 16 per cent of seafood imports in 2021. The main sources were
India ($222M), Viet Nam ($206M), China ($89M), and Thailand ($64M). Most shrimp
imported to Canada is frozen cultured shrimp.
Lobster constituted 12 per cent of seafood imports in 2021, essentially all ($546M) from
the United States. New Brunswick is the main importer of lobster from the US, much of
which is processed and exported. Such two-way trade flows provide important
opportunities for Canadian value-adding industries.

Overall Canadian seafood imports have recovered from the impacts of COVID-19
without a disproportionate increase in prices. Imports allow Canada to enjoy a more
diverse range of seafood products than would otherwise be the case. They also support
important value adding industries, as in the case of New Brunswick lobster imports.
